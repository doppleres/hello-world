# hello-world

Hi there!

My name is Elijah Sumner, I am a freshamn meteorology student at SUNY Oswego. I've loved the weather my entire life, and I can't wait to learn more about it.

I've also recently found a love for GIS and computer programs. I'm currently in the final develpoment stages for a program that automatically creates a map of all the school closings in northeasten Pennsylvania, and uploads them to a website that I host from a server I created in my basement at home. I've been able to mostly create this cost-free (except for purchasing a domain), by using open source software (such as QGIS, Notepad++, XAMPP, etc...) and coding all the websites and programs on my own.

Self teaching is one of the best ways to learn!
